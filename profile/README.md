# About Us
- Who are we?
	- We're a random couple of people on the internet that makes a bit of FNF mods.
- What mods are you working on and will you make projects unrelated to FNF?
	- We're currently working on:
		- Scribblematic Funkin'
		- Friday Night Knock-Knockin'
	- We are are not able to see what will we do next once we finish the FNF mods we're making.
- How much time does it take to make a mod or an update?
	- A lot. Not because it's difficult, we're slow because:
		- We have our own personal lives
		- We're lazy
		- We spend time with our outsider friends
		- We integrate and enjoy spending our time with each other on the server by sending memes etc. etc.
		- We work on other mods

- How to join the team and contact you?
	- Contacting us might not be easy and we suggest that you should consider that strongly. We don't always behave properly. If you'd like to join, find one of us and we might add you.

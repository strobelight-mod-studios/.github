# About Us
- Who are we?
	- We're a random couple of people on the internet that makes a bit of FNF mods.
- What mods are you working on and will you make projects unrelated to FNF?
	- We're currently working on:
		- Scribblematic Funkin'
		- Friday Night Knock-Knockin'
	- We are are not able to see what will we do next once we finish the FNF mods we're making.
- How much time does it take to make a mod or an update?
	- A lot. Not because it's difficult, we're slow because:
		- We have our own personal lives
		- We're lazy
		- We spend time with our outsider friends
		- We integrate and enjoy spending our time with each other on the server by sending memes etc. etc.
		- We work on other mods
- What people do you have on the team?
	- Kaskudek - He's the owner and founder of the team. He's a talented artist and a proffesional Bloodrayne simp
	- teotm - Co-Onwer of the team and the coder and song charter. The more he codes, the more he improves.
	- I hope you step on a lego (aka chill grunt) - Kind of a Co-Owner and a JoJo fan

	- and a bit more...
- How to join the team and contact you?
